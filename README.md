# Dance Dance Revolution Remake

Hello!

This 2D game was a project that was due in one of my Fall 2021 classes at San Diego State University.
The class is called CS583 - 3D Game Programming.

This game is a copy of Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) made from the ground up in Unity with C#.
I used DDR as inspiration because I wanted to do a rhythm game, and, since DDR is a "classic" rhythm game that
I always used to play, I wanted to remake it from scratch myself.

This repository was originally on Rijeka, and I just imported it to GitHub so that I could let people view it publicly.

If you are interested in trying the game out, the "Releases" folder has the final working version.

Thank you for taking a look!
