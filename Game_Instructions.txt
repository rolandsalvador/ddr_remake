DANCE^2 CIRCUMVOLUTION

----- How to Play -----
Dance^2 Circumvolution is a single-player rhythm game where the player must press the
corresponding arrow key at the correct timing. Beware, if the player
misses too many notes or is off beat for too long, they will fail the stage!

The player must try their best to stay on beat and not miss too many notes. The window for
error depends on the difficulty of the current stage. The better your timing, the higher your
score. The more notes in a row you hit, the higher your multiplier, and the more you score.
