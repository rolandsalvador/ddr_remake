The code for scripts ButtonController, EffectObject, NoteObject, and many
parts of GameManager are from gamesplusjames tutorials. 
All the code that was taken or inspired from the tutorials are in the videos themselves.
Hitting the notes and configuring their hitboxes, playing the music and missing notes,
calculating and displaying score and their multipliers, timing hits for better scores,
and showing results and ranking are the prominent aspects of the game that were taken
or inspired by the tutorial.

However, everything else, such as the UI, SceneController, PrefabScroller, PlayerData,
HealthBarController are things that I have created myself and figured out. This includes
the pause menu, stage select, and main menu and title screens.

It is worth mentioning that instead of gamesplusjames way of displaying and holding notes
was not used. Instead of putting all notes directly onto the scene, I instead configured
my own way of spawning note/arrow prefabs randomly every 1 second.

Please let me know if I am required to cite the exact code that I used from gamesplusjames
tutorials, as I am not deliberately trying to pass off most of the game's mechanics as
my own.
